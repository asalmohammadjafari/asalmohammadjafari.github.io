I am a final-year Computer Science student at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), maintaining a 3.91/4 GPA and ranking among the top students. As an AI researcher, I explore various problems and experiment with new methodologies in artificial intelligence to develop effective solutions. Beyond research, my experience as a teaching assistant has deepened my understanding of various subjects and enabled me to effectively support students in their learning.
